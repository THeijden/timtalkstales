        <br>
        <p class="text-sm lg:text-base text-center italic font-proza-libre">Warning: minor spoilers for season 1 and 2 are included to illustrate some points</p>
        <br>
        <p> Imagine for a second a world where superpowers start to develop in individuals. People gain incredible strength, go flying through cityscapes and make plants grow wherever they want with just a touch. As this becomes more and more common, regulations and new ways in which society work start shaping everyday life to accommodate for this new way of living. The roles of "hero" and "villain" start emerging as different groups of people respond differently to this development. </p>
        <br>
        <p> Now imagine you are born into this world, but as part of a very small minority who do not develop any powers. This is the story of our protagonist, Midoriya Izuku, as he struggles through his forming teenage years. Being bullied by his classmates and especially his childhood friend Bakugo Katsuki for not having a "quirk", Midoriya finds himself at a low point. And yet, despite his predisposition, Midoriya has the capacity to remain optimistic as he idolizes heroes and especially the one who stands at the very top: All Might. </p>
        <br>
        <p> This all changes when a villain goes on a rampage, and holds Bakugo hostage in an attempt to escape the eclosing grasp of the heroes. All Might, despite being present at this disaster, hesitates to come to Bakugo's rescue as he suffers from an injury that limits his strength output to a time limit, and it is all used up for the day. Being conflicted, All Might is unsure what to do… until Midoriya rushes the villain in a desperate attempt to rescue Bakugo, even without having any power himself. Seeing this, All Might is inspired and reminded of what it means to be a hero, and pushes past his limit to rescue both Bakugo and Midoriya. Feeling gratitude towards Midoriya for showing him the way of a hero again, All Might decides to take Midoriya as his apprentice and sends him to the number 1 hero school he himself graduated from: UA. And so, Midoriya's hero academia begins. </p>

        <!-- what i liked section -->
        <p class="text-xl text-center underline font-proza-libre">What I liked</p>
        <br>
        <p> The world of My Hero Academia, for its simplistic setup, feels interesting and lived in. Quirks are applied in all aspects of life, not just fights and rescue operations. They could for example be used in construction, or in everyday tasks. In addition, hero schools have special courses and examinations that are a perfect match for the world on display (think support courses and provisional licenses). But at the same time, a world with quirks would also realistically create discrimination and radicalize groups against the established regime that shuns dangerous or scary quirks. It is a fine balance. </p>
        <br>
        <p> As an extension to this, fights are frequent, and often a visual spectacle. However, they are about emotion and trying to come through to the other person. This makes them battles of ideologies and beliefs (about themselves, other people, society etc.), not necessarily bouts of strength or showmanship. It becomes evident in a character like Bakugo, who beats up Midoriya in order to show him that people without quirks are meaningless (in his juvenile worldview) while secretly also being scared of his kindness and courage. Or think about the battle between Midoriya and Todoroki Shoto in the UA tournament of season 2, where Midoriya tries to convince Todoroki that he can be his own person if he wants, instead of just a shallow copy of his father who he must reject at all costs. This makes for a very intriguing watch, as you are constantly rooting for individual characters and question your beliefs about the story and its world while exposed to new points of view. At the same time, fighting with all your spirit has tangible consequences when characters push their bodies and minds to their absolute limits. As a result, central messages and themes throughout this story are simple yet strong. Some of my personal favorites were: </p>
        <br>
        <ul class="list-disc">
          <li class="ml-8"> Even without some kind of superpower or external validation, you can do great things and be loved. It is the power inside you that makes the difference, not what is out there or what is foretold. </li>
          <li class="ml-8"> You cannot and do not have to do things alone. Strength comes as much from yourself as the people you surround yourself with. </li>
          <li class="ml-8"> You have only been defeated if you give up yourself. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p> Finally, spanning 8 seasons, each one of them roughly containing 24 episodes, makes for a total runtime that is spread over almost 10 years of television. Normally, this would mean that the project would at least change animation studio's or some of its cast during the production process. Not here. As a result, it is an incredibly consistent watch, where a character or the display of a character stayed the same, much helped by stellar voice performances of the likes of Yamashita Daiki and Miyake Kenta. It makes you feel like you are growing up alongside them on screen as they experience their story, all in a very natural way. Combine this with the thick-line animation style, its distinct colors for each character and clear fighting choreography from Studio Bones, and you have a very pleasant watch. As a last point, I want to mention the weighty sounds effects on display for fights, as well as both the quiet as well as the grandiose moments accompanied by the beautiful OST of Yuki Hayashi. His "You Say Run" and "Hero Too" are all time classics and still dominate my Spotify playlists. They capture the essence of what it means to be a hero so well. </p>
        <br>

        <!-- what i did not like section -->
        <p class="text-xl text-center underline font-proza-libre">What I did not like</p>
        <br>
        <p> To make the world of My Hero Academia feel lived in, Kōhei Horikoshi opted for a rich display of different characters and their quirks throughout the seasons. I feel like this was done to enrich the worldbuilding and showing off different quirks and their applications. While I think it served its intended purpose, it also came with a mayor downside: it made the overall series lengthy and number of sub-plots numerous. Some were excellent, but others felt flat and did little to drive the plot forward or instigate meaningful growth or change in our main characters. As a result, it meant that they had less screentime, and some character arcs felt unresolved at the end. For example, two of our protagonists found it difficult to live with the consequences of their (in)actions. But we never see if or how they decide to live with this, something I was interested in in seeing. </p>
        <br>
        <p> Second, ultimatums were handled poorly. While the story did display the consequences of pushing your body and mind to its limits, tough choices where a character had to make a decision were rare and often resolved by some external force, for example another hero showing up. It would have resulted in much more growth for the characters and moving the plot forward at a faster pace if they actually had to make those decisions, and the consequences that came with it. </p>
        <br>

        <!-- conclusion section -->
        <p class="text-xl text-center underline font-proza-libre">Conclusion</p>
        <br>
        <p> Despite some gripes with the content and the length of the story, My Hero Academia is an excellent display of the classic hero tale that just feels very good to watch. Rooting for different characters and enjoying the consistent art, voice acting and sound on display were definitely highlights. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-center"> Overall, I recommend My Hero Academia. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-center"> And as always, thank you for reading! </p>
